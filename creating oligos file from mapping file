Creating the oligos file can be done manually in excel or automated in R. Both options are detailed below. 

1. Manually creating the oligos file in excel 
  a. Open the mapping file in excel.
	b. Clear the contents of column A and replace with the word “barcode” in each cell.
	c. Clear the contents of column C and replace with the word “NONE”. 
	d. Delete Columns D and E
	e. Delete Row 1. 
	f. Your table should now only include four columns (A. "barcode" B. the actual bacode string "TAGGACTA" C. "NONE" D. sample name
  g. Select columns A, B, C, and D; COPY and PASTE into a new notepad file
	h. SAVE notepad file as “Run1_16S_oligos.txt” in mothur folder 
		*naming will depend on specific run being processed

2. Using R to create oligos file from mapping file 
  a. Copy the following commands into R and run once the designated file path and file names are specified.  The file path, output file
  name, and input file name are highlighted for you to change
  
# load libraries (install as needed)
library(dplyr)

# read in formatting function
source('http://bit.ly/2dFrriu')
	
# set your working directory for the files location
setwd('D:/mothur v.1.37.6')

# mapping file to format
fl <- 'Run1_16S_09222016.txt'

# does it need a reverse complement
rev_cmp <- FALSE

# do you want to save the output to the working directory?
savefl <- TRUE

# what do you want to name the output file
flnm <- 'myfile.txt'

# format with the fucntion
moth_form(fl, rev_cmp, savefl, flnm)
